German-English Parallel Corpus for Word Alignment
Aligned by: Ergun Bicici
Corpus: Europarl
Copyright: 2014


This parallel corpus is manually word aligned and can be used for training and testing word alignment systems or statistical machine translation systems.

This parallel corpus was used for calculating the word alignment performance of regression based statistical machine translation systems developed as part of my thesis: "The Regression Model of Machine Translation", Ergun Bicici.

Contents:
test.[de|en]: Input to the word aligner.
de-en.wa: Word alignments of the sentences in the parallel corpus in GIZA++ format.
de-en.ref.wa: Word alignments of the sentences in the parallel corpus in a format for calculating alignment error rate (AER).
